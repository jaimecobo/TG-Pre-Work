<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- This declaration is an instruction, and it must be the first line of code in your HTML document.
  It tells the browser what type of document to expect, along with what version of HTML is being used in the document.
  For now, the browser will correctly assume that the html in <!DOCTYPE html> is referring to HTML5, as it is the current standard.
