/*
Scope is the context in which our variables are declared.
We think about scope in relation to blocks because variables can exist either outside of or within these blocks.
In global scope, variables are declared outside of blocks.
These variables are called global variables. 
Because global variables are not bound inside a block, they can be accessed by any code in the program, including code in blocks.
