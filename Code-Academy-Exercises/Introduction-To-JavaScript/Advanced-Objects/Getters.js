/*
Getters are methods that get and return the internal properties of an object.
But they can do more than just retrieve the value of a property!
Notable advantages of using a getter method:
Getters can perform an action on the data when getting a property.
Getters can return different values using conditionals.
In a getter, we can access the properties of the calling object using this.
The functionality of our code is easier for other developers to understand.
Another thing to keep in mind when using getter (and setter) methods is that properties cannot share the same name as the getter/setter function.
If we do so, then calling the method will result in an infinite call stack error. One workaround is to add an underscore before the property name
