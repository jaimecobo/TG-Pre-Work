/*
To set up a grid, you need to have both a grid container and grid items.
The grid container will be a parent element that contains grid items as children and applies overarching styling and positioning to them.
To turn an HTML element into a grid container, you must set the element's display property to grid
(for a block-level grid) or inline-grid (for an inline grid).
Then, you can assign other properties to lay out the grid.
