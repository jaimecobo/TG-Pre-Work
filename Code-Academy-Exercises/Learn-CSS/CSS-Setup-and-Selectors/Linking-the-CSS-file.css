/*
You can use the <link> element to link HTML and CSS files together.
The <link> element must be placed within the head of the HTML file.
It is a self-closing tag and requires the following three attributes:
href — like the anchor element, the value of this attribute must be the address, or path, to the CSS file.
type — this attribute describes the type of document that you are linking to (in this case, a CSS file).
The value of this attribute should be set to text/css.
rel — this attribute describes the relationship between the HTML file and the CSS file.
Because you are linking to a stylesheet, the value should be set to stylesheet.
